## Strings and regex

```{r}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

str_detect(string_vec, "jeff")
str_replace(string_vec, "jeff", "Jeff")
```


```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^i think") #detect the vector begins with 'i think'
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$") #detect that ends with 'i think'
```


```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "Time for a Pumpkin Spice Latte!",
  "went to the #pumpkinpatch last weekend",
  "Pumpkin Pie is obviously the best pie",
  "SMASHING PUMPKINS -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )

str_detect(string_vec,"[Pp]umpkin") #both capital/lower case is detected
```


```{r}
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-zA-Z]") #anything between 1-9 and with characters a-z/A-Z right behind
```


```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "7.11") #the . is a special character in regular expression, it matches with anything between 7 and 11
str_detect(string_vec, "7\\.11") # actual dot is detected, \is also special character
```


```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "\\[")
```



## Factors

```{r}
vec_sex = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))
vec_sex

as.numeric(vec_sex)
```

what happens if I relevel...

```{r}
vec_sex = fct_relevel(vec_sex, "male")
vec_sex

as.numeric(vec_sex)
```


## NSDUH

```{r}

```
